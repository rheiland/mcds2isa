Comment[notes]	"The tip and stalk DCL cell cycle arrests have very large uncertainty. Don't trust the model named 'total_logistic', use 'total' instead. See below for details. xpath: //phenotype_dataset[contains(@keywords,"tip,CD34+")]//cell_cycle[@model="total_logistic"]/cell_cycle_phase[@name="growth_phase"]/cell_cycle_arrest has such a large uncertainty that should not be trusted xpath: //phenotype_dataset[contains(@keywords,"stalk,CD34-")]//cell_cycle[@model="total_logistic"]/cell_cycle_phase[@name="growth_phase"]/cell_cycle_arrest has such a large uncertainty that should not be trusted"
