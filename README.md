# mcds2isa

This repo contains a Python script (mcds_dcl2isa.py) to convert MultiCellDS digital cell line files (.xml) to ISA-Tab files ({i_,s_,a_}*.txt). It also contains another Python script (convert_MCDS_DCLs.py) that will "walk" through an entire directory of MCDS DCL files and invoke the conversion script to generate the three ISA files in the same directory as the corresponding MCDS file.
